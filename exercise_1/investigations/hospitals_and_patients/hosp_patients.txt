Correlation Between Surveys and Combined Scores

Finally, to see if there was a correlation between hospital quality and patient survey
 responses, a simple correlation was done between the cumulative rank score and 
 variability with the survey response base scores and consistency measures reported 
 by the HVBP HCAHPS. 

Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a sizeable correlation between the combined 
average rank and the survey response base score for the hospital (r = 0.02).  There was 
a slightly stronger correlation when comparing with the survey consistency measure 
(r = -0.10), but nothing practically significant.  Similarly, there was virtually 
no significant correlation to speak of between the variability of a hospitals 
performance and the survey base score (r = -0.14) and consistency (r = -0.07).
