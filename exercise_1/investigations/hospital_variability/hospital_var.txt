Most Variable Procedures

Since the procedures were separated by category, it seemed reasonable to compare 
variation in procedure scores without attempting to bridge the different broad 
categories (i.e. TEC, Readm, Comp).  For this reason, the top ten most highly 
variable procedures were presented for each category.

Variability for a procedure was assessed by taking the standard deviation of all 
scores reported for that measure.

Here are the results for Readmission:
MORT_30_PN      Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Mortality Rate    2.36
MORT_30_STK     Death rate for stroke patients  2.09
MORT_30_HF      Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Mortality Rate        2
READM_30_HF     Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Readmission Rate      1.89
READM_30_CABG   Rate of unplanned readmission for CABG  1.68
MORT_30_AMI     Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30-Day Mortality Rate 1.63
READM_30_COPD   Rate of unplanned readmission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients     1.46
MORT_30_CABG    Death rate for CABG     1.45
MORT_30_COPD    Death rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients    1.42
READM_30_STK    Rate of unplanned readmission for stroke patients       1.34

For Timely and Effective Care:
STK_4   Thrombolytic Therapy    21.95
AMI_7a  Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes Of Hospital Arrival     18.78
OP_2    Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival   18.05
IMM_3_FAC_ADHPCT        Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination  16.35
VTE_5   Warfarin therapy discharge instructions 16.3
VTE_1   Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis      15.26
STK_8   Stroke Education        14.01
CAC_3   Home Management Plan of Care Document   12.72
IMM_2   Immunization for influenza      11.94
HF_1    Discharge instructions  11.83

And for Complications:
PSI_4_SURG_COMP Deaths among Patients with Serious Treatable Complications after Surgery   20.31
PSI_12_POSTOP_PULMEMB_DVT       Serious blood clots after surgery       1.7
COMP_HIP_KNEE   Rate of complications for hip/knee replacement patients 0.99
PSI_15_ACC_LAC  Accidental cuts and tears from medical treatment        0.79
PSI_14_POSTOP_DEHIS     A wound that splits open  after surgery on the abdomen or pelvis   0.36
PSI_90_SAFETY   Serious complications   0.2
PSI_6_IAT_PTX   Collapsed lung due to medical treatment 0.07
